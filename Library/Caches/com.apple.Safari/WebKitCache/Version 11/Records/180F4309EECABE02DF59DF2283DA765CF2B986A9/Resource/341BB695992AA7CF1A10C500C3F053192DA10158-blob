The experience I just had was appalling and can not even be classified as customer service. Jennifer W., my account manager, interrupted me and repeatedly told me I was wrong without even looking into my account, I asked to speak with her manager and she told me I would receive a call back. She called me back shortly after and told me that I was in fact not wrong, but the plans have changed and the one I had previously was discontinued. She then told me that she will send me to retention to cancel my plan. I asked to speak with her manager again and she told me he would not come to the phone. I told her that I was not happy with her level of customer service and she said that she has done nothing wrong. Only when I asked for her managers name did she have him come to the phone.\n\nBrett G. came to the phone and was a small step above Jennifer\u0027s customer service. He told me that he gave her the directive to send me to retention and refused to give me his last name because he did not feel the need. Not once did either of these customer service individuals attempt to retain any business or give me any options to try keep my business. \n\nAs a business professional and an HR manager, I would be concerned if my customer service team acted in such a manner. I will not refer Zip Recruiter to anyone I know and will share my experience if asked.","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","bestRating":"5","worstRating":"1","ratingValue":"1"},"publisher":{"@type":"Organization","name":"Trustpilot","sameAs":"https://www.trustpilot.com"},"inLanguage":"en"},{"@type":"Review","itemReviewed":{"@type":"Thing","name":"ZipRecruiter"},"author":{"@type":"Person","name":"Jeff Kyle","url":"https://www.trustpilot.com/users/5ac568f84de5666d34490936"},"datePublished":"2018-04-05T00:08:26Z","headline":"“Pro” Service: Horrible Results, Lies \u0026 Misrepresentation","reviewBody":"I had tried ZipRecruiter when I first opened my small business, less than one year ago. It was a terrible experience where the only candidates that I seemed to get were from out of the country for my hourly wage positions that require certifications in the state of California. \n\nAfter trying another job board that had been working but I wasn\u0027t getting a lot of action in the past couple of months, I decided to try Zip again. I was told that should I try the Pro subscription (at a much higher price) that I would see much better results through much better visibility, and although not guaranteed, if at any time Zip was not meeting my expectations I could rely on them to refund or credit my account appropriately.\n\nSo I tried the Pro level at a very high price and worked with the Zip team over the course of 3 weeks, leading to only 8 responses (including 1 out of the country), with none of them available for any of the 3 full-time positions that I was advertising for. Every week stating my displeasure with the results but willing to stay with them to see if some of the minor tweaks to my ads would help, at the end of 3 weeks, I finally asked to be connected to their billing department. Not only could I not get a refund or a credit. I was told the only they could do was state that they were sorry that I wasn\u0027t satisfied with my experience. They couldn\u0027t even refund the unused portion of my subscription that I requested with a full cancel of my ad subscription. \n\nI come to no other conclusion that to state that ZipRecruiter is, by and large, a scam. I was flat-out lied to and they completely misrepresented themselves in their sales process. For my money there are better options.","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","bestRating":"5","worstRating":"1","ratingValue":"1"},"publisher":{"@type":"Organization","name":"Trustpilot","sameAs":"https://www.trustpilot.com"},"inLanguage":"en"},{"@type":"Review","itemReviewed":{"@type":"Thing","name":"ZipRecruiter"},"author":{"@type":"Person","name":"Ana Winson","url":"https://www.trustpilot.com/users/5ac4b2f14de5666d34a647a8"},"datePublished":"2018-04-04T11:11:46Z","headline":"I want out, they\u0027re not allowing me.","reviewBody":"I got added to the system without my consent.

Based on what you do, they automatically create job alerts for you. MANY of them. There is NO way to currently stop or set preferences to get it to stop doing that.  SO after you have a FEW carefully created alerts, you\u0027re now looking at 30+ alerts, and you\u0027 re getting buried with emails from \u0022Phil\u0022.\n\n2. While you CAN go into the alerts area, and delete the auto-created alerts (over and over and over again!), BUT there is no way to sort the alerts.  So now you\u0027re hunt-and-pecking to get get rid of all the alerts you don\u0027t want, in order to keep only the ones you do want.  \n\n3. Maybe because of 1. and 2., I\u0027m getting MANY duplicate job leads.
